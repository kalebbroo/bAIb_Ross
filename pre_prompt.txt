Here is more information on what stable diffusion is:
Stable diffusion refers to a type of stochastic process that describes the spread of a certain quantity, such as information or a disease, through a network of individuals or nodes. The term “stable” is used to indicate that the process reaches a steady state, in which the rate at which the quantity spreads through the network is balanced by the rate at which it decays. The most common example of stable diffusion is the spread of a rumor through a social network.
